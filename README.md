A citation picker for academics that write in markdown. Using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), this citation picker inserts [Pandoc citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax) from a BibTeX File.

## Feature Overview
- Inserts __Pandoc Citation Syntax__ (`[@citekey]`). Works with page numbers & multiple citations.
- __works system-wide__, in case you also work in another Markdown app.
- __smart search:__ search for citekeys, authors, title, publication, keywords (tags), include/exclude authors in *et al*, tab-completion, fuzzy-matching, sorting recently used entries to the top, ‚Ä¶
- __feature-rich:__ paste single-entry bibliographies, open URLs, open or create literature notes, search for `.csl` files online, backup the library, ‚Ä¶
- __minimal reference manager__: add or remove entries without from the BibTeX library without the need for another reference manager.
- __Obsidian integration:__ When located in an Obsidian vault, literature notes will automatically be opened/created in Obsidian. (Otherwise, they will be opened in the default app for markdown files.)
- __very performant:__ considerably quicker than other citation pickers (~200ms to fully reload a library with ~4000 entries on my machine)
- __easy installation:__ no dependencies, no required plugins, no setup (other than entering the path to your `.bib` file).

<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->

## Setup
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/releases/latest).
2. In the workflow settings, set `bibtex_library_path` to the absolute path of your BibTeX library file (Workflow settings tutorial: [How to set environment variables in Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment)).
3. Set a hotkey for the citation picker by double-clicking the respective field in the workflow window.

## Usage
Press the hotkey in any text field to launch the citation picker.

### Search
- Search for the title, author/editor (last name), year, or, collection/journal-title.
- Prepend `@` to a word to search for a citekey, e.g. `@Grieser2020`.
- Prepend `#` to search for keywords (tags), e.g. `#sociology`.
- *Smart Queries*: You can search for any combination of the above. For example, the query `2020 #cognition Grieser *` will fuzzy-filter for entries published in 2020, with the tag "cognition", and with "Grieser" as author/editor.
- The workflow setting `match_authors_in_etal` determines whether authors (or editors) in the *et al.* are still matched when searching for them (default: *true*).

### Citation Actions
- `‚Üµ`: Paste the citekey of the selected citation.
- `‚å• + ‚Üµ`:  Add another citation.
- `‚åò + ‚Üµ`: Add page numbers before pasting the selected citekey. Confirm the page number with `‚å• + ‚Üµ` or `‚åò + ‚Üµ` to add another citation afterwards.
- *Tab-Completion*: Pressing `tab` autocompletes the first author/editor name.

### Icon Meanings

| Icon | Entry has       |
|:-----|:----------------|
| üåê   | URL or DOI      |
| üìì   | Literature Note |
| üìÑ   | Abstract        |
| üè∑ n | n Keywords      |

### URL Actions
- `‚åÉ + ‚Üµ`: Open the URL in the browser.
- `‚åò + C`: Copy the URL to the clipboard.

### Bibliography Actions
- `‚áß + ‚Üµ`: Reveal the entry in [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), depending on the setting `open_entries_in`.
- `fn + ‚Üµ`: Paste the full bibliographic entry in the APA 6th Style (requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)).
- `‚åò + L`: Preview the (unabridged) title, abstract, and list of keywords in Large Type.
- `‚åòfn + ‚Üµ`: Delete the entry from the BibTeX library (__Experimental__).
	- ‚ö†Ô∏è This feature is untested with BiBTeX files created with apps other than BibDesk and Bookends. [Create an issue](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/alfred-bibtex-citation-picker/issues) for problems with other apps.
- __add entries to the BibTex library__: use the Alfred Keyword `+`, followed by a space and a DOI
	- the DOI will be added to your library, with a properly formatted citekey (avoiding duplicates with existing library, etc.)
- Note that adding & removing entries does __not__ work with the [BetterBibTeX Zotero Plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), since the plugin only does a one-way-sync (Zotero ‚ûû BibTeX file), meaning any changes to the `.bib` file will be overridden.

### Literature Note Actions
- Add `*` to any __search__ query to filter only for entries with literature notes, e.g. `* grieser` will search for entries from "Grieser" with literature notes. Can be combined with other queries (see: [smart queries](#search)).
- `‚åò‚áß + ‚Üµ`: Open the literature note.
	- If the file is in an [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/), opens the file in Obsidian.
	- If there is no literature note, a new one will be created.
- `‚åò + Y`: Preview the literature note with QuickLook (requires QLmarkdown or Peek[^1]).
- *Both actions look for literature specified in the workflow settings `literature_note_folder`. The files must be named __exactly__ like the citekey (without `@`) and have a `.md` extension.*

## Auxiliary Features
Triggered via the Alfred Keyword `scp` (for `S`upercharged `C`itation `P`icker).
- __CSL Search__: Search for a citation style, which will be downloaded to the location `csl_folder` specified in your workflow settings (default: `~/.pandoc/csl/`).
- __Bibliography Stats__: Brief statistical summary of the library. (Currently only total number of citations.)
- __Cheatsheet: Pandoc Citation Syntax__: Open a cheat sheet for the Pandoc citation syntax.
- __Cheatsheet: Citation Picker Actions__: Open a cheat sheet of the available actions of the Supercharged Citation Picker.
- __Force Buffer Reload__: Force a reload of the citation picker for debugging purposes.
- __Autocompletion List__: Create an autocompletion list formatted for use with the [Various Complements Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=various-complements) in Obsidian.[^3]
- __Library Backup[^2]__: Create a Backup of your library in the location `backup_destination`, restricting the maximum number of backups to `max_number_of_bkps` (deleting the oldest backup). You can also use the following AppleScript to to trigger the backups, e.g. for a cron job:

```applescript
tell application id "com.runningwithcrayons.Alfred" to run trigger "BibTeX Library Backup" in workflow "de.chris-grieser.alfred-bibtex-citation-picker"
```

## About the Developer
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and compatibility.

[^1]: [QLmarkdown](https://github.com/sbarex/QLMarkdown) and [Peek](https://apps.apple.com/app/peek-quick-look-extension/id1554235898) both enable previewing of Markdown documents. Peek works with a wide range of other file types than Markdown, but costs around 5‚Ç¨. QLMarkdown is free, but only works for Markdown and requires some minor small setup. To enable the proper display of YAML headers, you need to enable the respective setting in the Advanced Options of QLMarkdown or Peek.

[^2]: As per [MIT License](LICENSE), this app comes without any warranty in case of data loss. That being said, I never had any problems with the backups created.

[^3]: Set the workflow setting `autocomplete_list_location` to the *absolute* path where the file should be created and use a `.md` extension. In the Various Complements settings, use "Prefix" as Matching Strategy, Pipe (`|`) as Delimiter, enable Custom Dictionaries, add the previously created file to the custom dictionary list, and set `Delimiter to divide suggestions for display from ones for insertion` to `>>>`. Afterwards, reload custom dictionaries via the command palette. (If the [Advanced URI Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-advanced-uri) is installed, the reloading of the custom dictionaries will be triggered automatically, if the file is already in the custom dictionary list!)
