# Pandoc-Suite for Citation and Bibliographies in Markdown

## What is does
This Alfred workflow enables academic citing and publishing with any markdown app like iA Writer, Ulysses, or Scrivener. It does so by offering a Zotero Citation Picker for [Pandoc Markdown Citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) and by automatically converting Markdown files into `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.html`, or `.pptx` with the proper bibliography. 

This workflow is made for academics who neither like Word nor LaTeX. As the name suggests, this workflow is basically a user-friendly interface for Pandoc, allowing you to make use of Pandoc's vast capabilities without ever needing to open the Terminal.
